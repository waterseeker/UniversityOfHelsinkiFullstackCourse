# UniversityOfHelsinkiFullstackCourse

This is my repo for the exercises in the Full stack oopen 2020 course through the University of Helsinki. 
You can find the course at: https://fullstackopen.com/en/

From their page:
"Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js."
